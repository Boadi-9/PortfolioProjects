# PortfolioProjects

This GitHub repository is dedicated to showcasing my portfolio projects, specifically designed to enhance my SQL skills. The projects cover various aspects of SQL including data exploration and data cleaning.

- The 'Data Exploration in SQL' project has been successfully completed. It features my code and queries developed for understanding complex data sets and extracting meaningful insights.

- The 'Data Cleaning in SQL' project is currently in progress. This project will demonstrate my proficiency in improving the quality of data by identifying and correcting errors, removing duplicates, and modifying the data to create a consistent dataset.
